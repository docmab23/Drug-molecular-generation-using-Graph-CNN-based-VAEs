# Molecular embeddings and De-novo drug generation

## The .ipynb notebook shows 2 things
* Shows how can we make molecular embeddings using different methods
* How can we generate molecules as graphs using Graph-CNN based Variation Autoencoder approach

### Different ways to make a molecular embedding as show in the notebook:
* Vectorize SMILES and train an Autoencoder to get a latent embedding for downstream tasks
*
